    "description": "Kubernetes runs the distributed replicas of an application completely independent with no mechanism provided for coordination between replicas. To minimize race conditions, and other side effects of distributability, applications are often deployed with a replica count limited one or use primitives like StatefulSet to influence pod scheduling stickiness. Unfortunately, these are not enough to create truly distributed applications that can gracefully react to changes in their environment at runtime. While the controller and operator patterns have helped, they tend to use raw API primitives that are not related to building distributed systems.  This presentation is a discussion that presents the features needed to create truly distributed applications that can react to changes in a distributed environment and including features such as leader election, synchronization, and coordination.",

Our microservices should be as close to pure business logic as possible, but what happens when we add so many services that our network requests are dramatically slowing the application down? The natural result is to look for some caching of requests on either the client or service side. Enter Redis, Memcached, and other caching tools all to help reduce network calls and overall latency. All of this comes with implementation penalty reducing the purity of our services. We will demonstrate how Istio's Mixer component can be used to cache requests at the request level and how that can keep your application fast, without ruining the purity of your services.",

When a Container is starting, the kubelet has no way to tell whether the startup is deadlocked or just taking longer than expected.

    "description": "This time last year, two people from Wales, United Kingdom decried to bring the CNCF to their doorstep.  Previously, they were attending international conferences and national meetups to meet and be a part of the community.  Knowing that they were in a privileged position, they wanted to share it with others that, for whatever reason, were unable to make these events.  Cloud Native Wales will be soon celebrating a year of meetups, and best of all, we get to share this with the 100's of people within our meetup community.  This talk will inspire you to take the chance to branch the CNCF and build a community closer to home, help others learn, share and contribute to the world wide community.",

With a slew of new rootless tooling emerging including Red Hat\u2019s buildah, Google\u2019s Kaniko, and Uber\u2019s Makisu, will we see build systems that can securely build untrusted Dockerfiles? How are traditional build and packaging requirements like reproducibility or hermetic isolation being approached?

Service Catalog lets you provision cloud services, regardless of where they are hosted, directly from the comfort of native Kubernetes tooling. This works across platforms because we follow the Open Service Broker API, an open standard to provision and manage cloud services. Learn how you can use Service Catalog to access third-party services from your Kubernetes applications. We will walk through provisioning a database directly through Kubernetes and and then connect to it from an application running on the cluster.",

In this session, we will present a new version of the Ingress and the Service APIs. These API\u2019s form the foundational blocks for managing your global, scalable and reliable services close to your users using a single control plane. Moreover, we will compare these new API\u2019s with different models for spreading services across multiple cluster (e.g Istio). We will demo a custom controller we have written that will configure multi-cluster HTTP(S) load balancing given these new API\u2019s.",

In an effort to prevent snowflake clusters, we provided a base set of services for logging, monitoring, etc.; however, application teams inevitably want to customize their logging solution or add a monitoring dashboard. We realized this mix of standard and optional services could quickly get out of control and needed normalization. In early 2018, we exposed application teams to Kubernetes manifests; they were excited about control over deployments, but unprepared for the complexity. By late 2018, we needed to minimize complexity and find a way to express high-level application needs, while providing secure, scalable and redundant deployments. This is our journey of how we embraced GitOps, and the challenges we faced making deployment descriptions minimalistic.",

As production environments become more complex, and dynamic - establishing trust between microservices is becomes more difficult, creating challenges for developers, operations teams, and security teams alike. Enter SPIFFE (Secure Production Infrastructure for Everyone) and which builds on designs first championed at Google, Twitter and elsewhere to provide robust authentication and trust between disparate micro-services. SPIFFE and SPIRE make it trivial to establish trust between workloads that may be elastically scaled and dynamically scheduled, and deployed in deeply heterogeneous environments. We'll walk through the design goals for SPIFFE (a specification) and SPIRE (a multi-cloud implementation of SPIFFE). We will go over all the developments and progress in SPIRE over the last few months. We will present an overview of how it can be used in conjunction with Kubernetes to build secure and scalable microservice architectures. We will also share our current roadmap with the community.",

However, the currently available approaches to extend it is rather limited. Since Envoy is written in C++, the primary way to introduce new extended functionality in Envoy is by writing an extension (e.g. filters, either network or HTTP filter, as one of the most relevant use-cases in Envoy), in C++. It is also possible to write an extension for Envoy using Lua, but the current scope of this extension is only for HTTP traffic. This talk introduces the new WebAssembly-based extension that allows extending Envoy with customized filters, logic and possibly protocol parsers i.e. written in arguably \u201cany\u201d languages, sandboxed and dynamically loadable.",

We will demonstrate a number of solutions available for specific problems, such as pod network policies, the open policy agent, custom controllers that gate API functionality.  We will also discuss problems with the namespace permission model, and possible alternatives. Namespaces create an arbitrary boundary around resources, which creates the need to then bridge those boundaries.

The final goal is to understand how Bazel can help developers achieve a fully hermetic and reproducible build environment, and how locally produced images can be connected from developers\u2019 machines to the remote cluster through the two-way communication proxy offered by Telepresence.",

Should we use immutable images or a complex configuration management solution? What about leveraging one of the managed service offerings? Or even one of the opinionated open source projects? The possibilities are endless but can also be dizzying.  In this talk, Josh and Craig provide an overview of both the successful (and sometimes not so successful) deployment patterns they have encountered across dozens of production Kubernetes users in nearly every industry vertical. They will identify the critical decision making processes that will enable \"Day 2\" operations, empower stakeholders, and ultimately yield successful Kubernetes outcomes.",

We will describe how Etsy uses Bazel, along with its container and Kubernetes support, to deploy many different services to multiple different clusters and environments.  Using a repeatable build process maximizes container layer caching and takes advantage of Kubernetes built in pod template hashing. With this caching in place, it becomes feasible to deploy all services in a large repo reliably without under-deploying -- not deploying changed components, leaving them unvalidated on master -- or over-deploying, waiting for a potentially expensive rollout despite not having made changes.  Bazel's rules_docker also allow you to build deterministic container images without the Docker daemon, simplifying CI/CD.",

We\u2019ll investigate the inherent challenges with serving stateful services from a scaling perspective while preserving responsiveness by designing for resilience and elasticity, using Akka\u2014an OSS library for distributed stateful apps\u2014as a concrete example.  We\u2019ll discuss design principles needed to address problems around data consistency, system integrity, and data locality, why they are key to maintain overall system behavior under failure and load and discuss pitfalls and requirements needed to understand when operating the infrastructure fabric\u2014f.e.

David shares how they recovered and learned to operate many clusters automatically and safely.  In 2017, Spotify planned the migration of hundreds of teams, thousands of services, and tens of thousands of hosts to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). In the last half of 2018, Spotify migrated 50 teams and hundreds of services, including critical ones, onto multiple production clusters. \u00a0David describes what led to the cluster deletions and how they barely affected users. Since the postmortem, Spotify has minimized downtime and human error by declaratively defining clusters in code with Terraform, backing up and restoring clusters with Ark, and increasing scalability and availability by running many more clusters.",

In this talk I separate fact from fiction. Storage on Kubernetes can mean a lot of things. First I will start by separating three layers: 1) consuming block and file storage from a pod running in Kubernetes, 2) deploying a stateful app (like a database) on Kubernetes using storage and workload primitives, and 3) deploying a software defined storage system on top of Kubernetes to provide block or file storage. Each of these areas has a different set of challenges that are often conflated to make storage on Kubernetes appear much harder than it is. \u00a0After separating these layers, I will help you understand what the challenges are with each of them, and how you work around them to effectively deploy stateful applications on Kubernetes.",

As a result, users often have to choose between running their entire workload on a single cloud provider or region, and managing multiple clusters in different clouds.

    "description": "The Rook project has established robust and reliable patterns for orchestrating storage systems running on-top of Kubernetes clusters. However, storage systems often need to extend beyond a single cluster to provide data to end users in many different locations. How can these globally distributed storage systems best be orchestrated and managed to meet the needs of their users on a global scale?  In this talk, we will examine the key concepts of storage orchestration for cloud native applications in multicloud environments, as well as the major benefits of these types of deployments. We will learn about the challenges that arise and best practices to address them, such as replication, mirroring, snapshots, and disaster recovery. All of these lessons will be in the context of the Rook project, including a live demonstration of storage orchestration on a global scale.",

But the rapid development of SSD technology, along with container and Kubernetes, make it possible to create a more elegant solution from scratch, compared to the storage technologies exist tens of years ago.  So they have created a storage solution based on Kubernetes.  In Longhorn, control flow is driven by Kubernetes's controller model; deployment is done using Kubernetes workload; HA is backed by Kubernetes's HA capability. Though sometimes it's easy to say than done. As a result, lots of insights were gained on how to write an application based on Kubernetes.

Last year we finally kicked off the daunting multi-year task of migrating everything to gRPC.  Migrating over 1000 services to gRPC poses interesting challenges, many of them are not only technical in nature: they boil down to questions of engineering culture and leadership at scale: How do you get 200 autonomous engineering teams to align on something as fundamental and cross-cutting as a new RPC framework? How do you roll-out gRPC at scale whit minimal disruption to both the organization and to the end-user?  This presentation will address these questions alongside more technical discussions of advanced gRPC concepts such as interceptors, deadlines, and effective schema management and how they are essential in large distributed systems.",

But doing that requires that kops manage that complexity. We\u2019ve had a busy year, migrating to etcd3, moving from an aggregated-apiserver to CRDs, starting to adopt the cluster-api. At the same time we\u2019re taking the best pieces of kops and contributing them \"upstream\" into reusable modules - contributing to etcd-management and addon-management tools, as well as to the cluster-api.  We\u2019ll give an overview of these changes and some of the challenges we faced, and share our strategies for dealing with the relentless pace of kubernetes change. We\u2019ll also talk about how the upcoming roadmap for kubernetes, kops and for the components we\u2019re spinning out of kops.",

The default Kubernetes scheduler dates back from earlier more modest deployments. It is queue-based, processing unscheduled pods in sequential fashion. For a large Kubernetes clusters, such scheduler processing logic can introduce long, even unbounded scheduling latencies, negatively affecting overall throughput for workload deployments. This talk outlines how Kubernetes is a victim of its own success, scheduling-wise. It lays out the current pod queuing challenges and describes a novel scheduling approach based on Flow Network Graph technique, enabling low workload scheduling latencies at scale. The presentation details the resulting extreme efficiencies and high quality placement decisions of such an approach and the accompanying pluggable scheduling policies.",

We will do an overview and deep dive in all 3 metric APIs, with a concrete fully open source Prometheus based deployment example. Once we have Prometheus running we will show how to bridge the gap between Prometheus and Kubernetes to use these APIs.

This talk provides an architectural overview of the self-healing capabilities of Kubernetes. We will discuss how these capabilities are born from the declarative API, and how Kubernetes components work together to drive to the desired state. We will provide detailed examples from the volume subsystem which automatically makes storage available to containers.

The mpi-operator, on the other hand, utilize MPI allreduce primitive implementation. While the parameter server strategy requires a right ratio of CPU (for parameter servers) and GPU (for workers) to reach network-optimal, the all reduce distribution might be easier to optimize network cost.

This talk presents the profound insights trace aggregates help unlock, including sources of resource contention, latency anomalies in the context of service infrastructure, and correlations of metrics with high-cardinality characteristics of the distributed system. The talk demonstrates, using concrete examples, how novel applications of aggregated traces reveal new opportunities for performance improvements.

Unfortunately implementing effective and maintainable policies can be quite challenging. Many organizations end up struggling with a common set of challenges as they try to implement RBAC across their clusters. These challenges have often resulted in insecure configuration that grants far more access than necessary.   In this talk, Rob will highlight open source tools and best practices that address many of these common challenges. This presentation aims to make RBAC more approachable for all, and will provide a straightforward path toward effective and maintainable configuration that can make your cluster more secure.",

With this context, we will share a matrix of secure container runtimes from CRI perspective. For example, what's the attacking surface & isolation mechanism? Is there independent guest kernel? Does it support certain CRI feature? We will discuss which dimension will be hidden by CRI and which will not, and what this means for Serverless & its users.  We will also share how we map CRI Matrix into RuntimeClass, choose proper runtime, and then setup Serverless platform. The design & adoption of RuntimeClass will be evaluated here as well.",

We\u2019ll start by diving into the DNS problem, the motivation for the feature as well as the design and implementation. Attendees will learn how to use this feature on their clusters.In addition to the latency issue itself, visibility into DNS has been a pain point for many users. Not any more! The metrics exposed by the local DNSCache provides insight into user workloads' DNS needs. We\u2019ll show some of these metrics, along with a demo of how the feature works.

After we review the design choices and architecture of the cluster, we will use it to showcase the use of Rook, the CNCF's incubation project designed to be a cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, turning storage technologies into a service completely transparent to the user.   A comprehensive examination of uses and open problems will complement our review of Rook's architecture.

    "description": "The declarative programming model of Kubernetes is markedly different from what most developers are used to. That the API is a set of resources rather than a list of methods on objects is a bit mind bending. But this programming model is not entirely new \u2013 rather, it smacks quite heavily of functional programming.  Functional programming had mostly been relegated to academic endeavors until recently. What\u2019s changed that is that our apps are now distributed systems and are simply too complex for us to reason about without help. Kubernetes helps.   In order to effectively use Kubernetes to deploy and manage your workloads you need to understand some of the principles of functional programming and how they surface in K8s. In this session I will cover these underlying principles of the K8s programming model so that you can up the robustness and manageability of your application deployments.",

With Bazel, we can build Docker images, generate Kube objects, and deploy to a live cluster in a single step.  We'll also see how to use Bazel to parameterize YAML files and deploy slightly different configurations to different environments, without having to repeat and duplicate entire manifests.

    "description": "TPM is a discrete tamper-resistant device soldered to the motherboard and it operates independently of its host.  TPM devices are designed to protect sensitive credentials at the hardware level: credentials created and stored within TPM devices cannot be extracted, even if host is compromised. Additionally, TPM devices provide a suite of cryptographic operations for applications to leverage.  In this demo heavy session, we will review core TPM capabilities and how they could be used in for extending Kubernetes security.   Attendees will leave with understanding how to utilize TPM in the context of Kubernetes. Concretely, the following scenarios will be covered: - Bootstrap trusted identity of cluster nodes  - Seal sensitive data  - Generate cryptographically protected logs - Generate unexportable TLS credentials",

The solution relies on a combination of an MQTT broker such as Google IoT Core together with an edge deployed registry, database and serverless functions. In this retail solution, all edge devices are managed in the cloud, while edge computing is managed through serverless functions. Edge storage is managed with a multi model database which stores time series and machine learning models, building applications on top of Kubernetes to benefit from a cloud-native architecture. Lev will demonstrate the update of functions through the MQTT broker, managing revisions and monitoring status. He will also demo machine learning models for image recognition and predictive analytics with serverless.",

As soon as a change is in the mainline it\u2019s on the release train and any subsequent changes traditionally ended up in a queue. If that change has a delay, then all subsequent changes get stuck and then have to be released together.  There are many ways to try and avoid these problems, but one way is to stop items getting on the release train until it's ready.  Istio does many things, but the traffic management functionality is the key to this solution. It allows traffic to be routed to different versions of the same service. The Wealth Wizards implementation will route all traffic to the mainline or master version of a service by default. However, if the hostname includes a version prefix then it will route traffic to the corresponding version of the service, if it exists.",

The SLOs making that definition were described in more detail in the first scalability-related Kubernetes blog post. However, as Kubernetes was maturing and new features were being added to it, it turned out that the initial definition is becoming meaningless, especially for larger users. In this presentation, we will explain how the definition was evolving over time and where we are heading, what are our principles driving that evolution and what efforts were spawned as a result of that (such as new SLIs/SLOs effort, testing tooling etc.)",

As of early 2019, Docker, Virtlet, containerd, cri-o and Sylab\u2019s Singularity project all implement the CRI! If you add in Kata containers and AWS Firecracker, the unique number of CRI combinations is growing rapidly.  How would you decide which CRI implementation is right for you? Clearly each have tradeoffs that are worth understanding whether you are a developer or operator.  We'll live demo each CRI runtime and summarize the details and why a cluster might choose\u2014or not choose\u2014a particular runtime. It will be a fast-paced but hopefully informational talk for those looking to understand the CRI runtime landscape!",

Difficulties involving platform-aware applications, supporting multiple authentication schemes, and maintaining complex authorization logic are all commonplace, despite the fact that we'd really rather avoid these things.  SPIFFE provides a platform-agnostic identity layer that can be used to authenticate and secure workload communication regardless of where the workload lives. AWS, Azure, and on-prem? Ok! Kubernetes, Mesos, and bare metal? No problem! SPIFFE allows you to mix and match without the need to worry about how workloads within them will securely communicate with each other.  In this talk, we will leverage SPIRE to demonstrate automated issuance of SPIFFE identity across disparate orchestrators and platforms, allowing for seamless authentication of systems within and between them.",

Specifically, how do we  * provide consistent, reliable performance? * efficiently utilitize hardware? * isolate customer traffic and reduce blast radius? * measure service scalability without replicating Prod?  To overcome these challenges, many companies including AWS build services using a cellular architecture, isolating customers and resources down to distinct subsets of services known as a cell. Cells act as a \"thinnest possible layer\" known as a cell router, which acts as a proxy for cell routing and resource migration. As cells have a defined size, we can test their scalability independently of production.  This talk will explain what cellular architecture is, techniques for implementing for your services, and how Envoy can operate as a cell router within a service mesh.",

Discussion spans complex questions of what support is desirable and viable in the minds of users, vendors, and ecosystem code contributors. This presentation will provide an overview of first half of our 2019 survey findings, describe progress towards and future work remaining to achieve a higher level of critical API stability, and outline the shape of possible support enhancement proposals.",

In k8s, each node effectively becomes a switch/router of the traffic passing between the PODs. Some k8s CNI plugins allow using these protocols to export traffic flow information as well. Together with good analysis tools, this can provide better visibility into the network in the cluster (both in real time and in history), which is crucial for debugging networking issues, identifying the bottlenecks, or investigation of security incidents.  In this talk, I will showcase how a powerful IPFIX collector and analyzer for k8s can be build using existing open-source tools: GoFlow and Logstash for collecting and post-processing of the flow records, Elasticsearch as the storage and search engine for the flows, and Prometheus + Kibana for easy observability of the flows.",

With this comes the dreaded cold-start problem: When a user's application is not in use for an extended period an activating request can take significantly longer to complete. Knative is no different in this respect and until recently our cold-start time was measured in seconds due to the cost of Kubernetes deployments. Recently, a large effort was undertaken to improve this delay and the result is a system which scales Kubernetes deployments up from 0 in under a second. We will dive deep into what actually goes on inside Kubernetes when a deployment is scaled up, where time is spent, and then some of our novel techniques to drastically speed up this process.",

Enforcing policies to protect the data is difficult because it often affects the entire stack, requires state from multiple locations, and must evolve over time as business needs change.

In this talk I\u2019ll introduce the concept of the Service Profile, a custom Kubernetes resource used by Linkerd. The service profile lets operators define permitted routes for the service with regular expressions, which allows Prometheus to scrape and aggregate service behaviors in a manageable way.

We will first discuss how flow data can help you monitor service architecture and assess the health of microservices. Next we will focus on how you can use BPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to extract flow data without any changes to application code, aggregate it across pods, services, and namespaces, and analyze it with Prometheus. Finally, we will show this in action in our production cluster, and discuss some of challenges that emerge as you roll it out at scale.",

The project has made impressive progress in the last few releases on those.  As scalability is a cross-cutting effort across different verticals, we would like to use this opportunity to walk you through the recent scalability/performance improvements made to kubernetes in different areas and introduce the new APIs and patterns that led to these.

K8s is a great project that aggregates a large number of computing nodes and providing container service to tenants, which also provides very basic isolation features. However, the isolation is still not good enough to serve the public cloud scenario. There are some flaws existing in both k8s and its dependency containerd.

TV service providers must modernize and accelerate their operations, moving from dedicated hardware in datacenter to embracing hybrid cloud technologies, DevOps and orchestration, while considering cloud frameworks constraints which aren\u2019t natively designed for real-time media - and issues such as high processing & storage performance, network (latency, bandwidth, multicast), high availability and reliability.  We will present our journey since 2015, showcasing how our architecture migration to microservices / containers / Kubernetes & Helm helped to lay the foundations for our global development team. We will share our architectural designs and explain how we overcame challenges such as K8s deployments, CNI, monitoring and packaging with Helm.",

    "description": "Machine learning is becoming more and more popular in the technology world. The community is beginning to leverage Kubernetes to deploy and manage the machine learning workload.  One of the key challenges is to schedule the GPU-intensive workload. The Kubernetes has included GPU support for applications. However, there are some limitations of GPU usage:  1. GPU assignment is exclusive. Containers cannot share GPU resources. 2. A container can request one or more GPUs, but it is not possible to request a fraction of a GPU.  This session introduces how to run workload using the GPU in Kubernetes. In addition, an approach will be demonstrated to use virtual GPU (vGPU) technology to enable multiple pods concurrently accessing the same physical GPU. This approach not only increases the utilization of GPU resources, it also allows more GPU workloads to be scheduled on the same physical GPU.",

In this intermediate-level talk David Kaltschmidt shows how structuring dashboards in a particular way can be a helpful guide when you get paged in the middle of the night. Reducing cognitive load makes oncall more effective. When dashboards are organized hierarchically on both the service and the resource level, troubleshooting becomes an exercise of divide and conquer. The oncall person can quickly eliminate whole areas of problems and zone in on the real issue. At that point a single service or instance should have been identified, for which more detailed debugging can take place.",
